# Neural Network Library Summary

**Repository**: [Thomas-Bergmann/neuralnetwork](https://github.com/Thomas-Bergmann/neuralnetwork)

## What It Is

A basic Java neural network library forked from Kim Marcel's project, with some improvements for build automation and
Maven distribution. This is an educational/hobbyist library based on Daniel Shiffman's YouTube tutorials, not a
production-grade machine learning framework.

## Key Features

- **Basic feedforward networks** with customizable layers
- **Three activation functions**: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU
- **Simple training**: Basic backpropagation with adjustable learning rate
- **File persistence**: Save/load networks as JSON
- **Genetic algorithm helpers**: Copy, mutate, and merge networks
- **Processing integration**: Works with the Processing creative coding environment

## Technical Details

- **Java 21** required
- **Dependencies**: EJML for matrix math, Gson for JSON
- **Build**: Gradle with GitHub Actions
- **Distribution**: Available on Maven Central as `de.hatoka.neuralnetwork:neuralnetwork:2.0.0`

## Realistic Assessment

**Good for:**

- Learning how neural networks work under the hood
- Simple classification/regression experiments
- Creative coding projects in Processing
- Understanding genetic algorithm approaches to neural networks

**Not suitable for:**

- Production machine learning applications
- Large datasets or complex models
- Performance-critical applications
- Modern deep learning techniques (no GPU support, limited architectures)

**Limitations:**

- Basic implementation without advanced optimizations
- No convolutional layers, LSTM, or other modern architectures
- Limited documentation and examples
- Small community/maintenance

## Bottom Line

This is a solid educational library for understanding neural network fundamentals and experimenting with basic machine
learning concepts in Java. If you're learning about neural networks or need something simple for creative projects, it's
useful. For serious machine learning work, you'd want established frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Java-based
options like DL4J.
